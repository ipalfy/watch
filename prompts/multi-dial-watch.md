# Create a simulation of a very special wristwatch in javascript.

## Description of the functionality
- This watch has a concentric design and shows the current time and date
- But instead of hour-, minute- and second hands there are three dials for the time that move in a way that the current time is displayed a on top center.
- Also add dials for weekday, day and month, where the longest periods, nonths should be at to and the shortest on bottom.
- While the top-center parts showing the current time and date are clearly visible, all other parts of the dials should appear under frosted glass.
- Add a button attached to the watch on the right (as they are usually) tha toggles between light- and dark mode.


## Description of the visual design
- The design should be based on Dieter Rams and Braun watch design philosopy.
- Those dials do move, but are animated and locked in when the time changes.


## How the code should be done
- Write the code in a new file: demos/dials.html
- The HTML / CSS should be fully responsive.
- Make sure the code is easily modifiable.
